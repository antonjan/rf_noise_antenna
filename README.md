# rf_noise_antenna
This repository will have all the details for the active antenna board for Rasdpberry PI<br>
This project will have the Raspberry Pi HAT that will switch in the LOW and HIGH pass filters depending on IO-PIN4 on raspberry Pi.<br>
There is also a Isolation transformer on the board to eliminate the DC ground from the antenna and generating noise.<br>
This antenna consists of a raspberry HAT for RF filter and power injection for the active Antenna.<br>
